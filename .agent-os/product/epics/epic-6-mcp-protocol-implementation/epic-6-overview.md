# Epic 6: MCP Protocol Implementation

## Overview
Implement comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) support to extend agent capabilities through external MCP servers, following the patterns established in gemini-cli-source and industry best practices.

## Goals  
- Implement full MCP protocol specification compliance
- Enable agents to discover and use MCP server tools and resources
- Support multiple transport mechanisms (Stdio, SSE, HTTP)
- Provide secure and configurable MCP server management
- Establish foundation for extensible agent capabilities

## Success Criteria
- Agents can discover and connect to MCP servers configured in mcp_settings.json
- MCP tools are available to agents and properly integrated into LLM context
- Multiple transport types supported (Stdio, SSE, HTTP) 
- Tool execution includes proper confirmation flows and security measures
- MCP servers can be managed through configuration and CLI commands
- Rich content types (text, images, binary data) properly handled in tool responses

## Dependencies
- Core agent engine from Epic 1
- Provider abstractions from Epic 3  
- Multi-provider authentication from Epic 5

## Technical Architecture
- MCP client implementation following protocol specification
- Discovery and connection management system
- Tool registration and execution framework
- Transport layer abstraction (Stdio/SSE/HTTP)
- Security and confirmation mechanisms
- Integration with existing agent tooling system
