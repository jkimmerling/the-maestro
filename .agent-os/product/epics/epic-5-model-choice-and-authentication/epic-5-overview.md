# Epic 5: Model Choice & Authentication System

## Overview
Implement comprehensive model selection and authentication management for both UI and TUI interfaces, enabling users to choose between Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT with flexible authentication options.

## Goals
- Provide unified model selection experience across UI and TUI interfaces
- Support multiple authentication methods (OAuth, API Key)
- Enable dynamic model discovery from providers
- Create seamless authentication flows for each interface type
- Establish foundation for provider-agnostic agent interactions

## Success Criteria
- Users can select from Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT providers in both UI and TUI
- Authentication flows work seamlessly for both OAuth and API key methods
- Model lists are dynamically fetched from each provider
- Chat interfaces become available after successful authentication and model selection
- System maintains authentication state across sessions

## Dependencies
- Existing authentication system from Epic 2
- Core agent engine from Epic 1
- Provider abstractions from Epic 3

## Technical Architecture
- Extend existing authentication system with multi-provider support
- Create provider discovery and model enumeration services
- Implement authentication flow orchestration
- Add model selection components to both UI and TUI
- Enhance session management to include provider/model context
