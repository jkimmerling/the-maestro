## 2025-08-11: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build "The Maestro" - an Elixir-based AI agent replication system targeting developers who need robust, fault-tolerant AI agents with model-agnostic architecture. Focus on superior reliability through OTP supervision, comprehensive tool sandboxing, and production-ready multi-user capabilities with flexible authentication strategies.

### Context

The market has sophisticated AI agent frameworks (like gemini-cli) built on Node.js/TypeScript, but they lack the intrinsic fault tolerance, state management, and supervision capabilities needed for production systems. Elixir's OTP provides a unique architectural advantage for building resilient AI agent systems. There's an opportunity to create a demonstrably superior platform that leverages a more appropriate technology stack.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Port gemini-cli to TypeScript/Node.js with improvements**
   - Pros: Familiar technology stack, existing patterns, faster initial development
   - Cons: Inherent limitations of single-threaded event loop, lacks native fault tolerance, manual state management

2. **Build on Python with async frameworks**
   - Pros: Rich AI/ML ecosystem, many developers familiar with Python
   - Cons: GIL limitations for concurrency, lacks supervision trees, memory management issues

3. **Go-based microservices architecture**
   - Pros: Strong concurrency, good performance, familiar to many developers
   - Cons: Requires complex orchestration, manual supervision implementation, less elegant actor model

### Rationale

Elixir/OTP provides unique advantages for this use case:
- Native fault tolerance through supervision trees
- Isolated processes for each user session preventing cascade failures
- Built-in state management and process recovery
- Excellent concurrency model for handling multiple simultaneous conversations
- Pattern matching and functional programming paradigms well-suited for agent logic
- Phoenix LiveView provides real-time UI with minimal client-side complexity

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Superior fault tolerance and reliability compared to existing solutions
- True model-agnostic architecture through behaviour-based adapters
- Self-healing systems that recover from failures automatically
- Scalable architecture supporting many concurrent users
- Rich real-time web interface with minimal JavaScript complexity
- Production-ready security and authentication features

**Negative:**
- Smaller developer community compared to Node.js/Python
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with Elixir/OTP
- Fewer AI-specific libraries compared to Python ecosystem
- Need to build LLM client integrations rather than using existing robust libraries

## 2025-08-11: Architecture Pattern Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Phoenix Context pattern for domain organization, OTP GenServer per user session for state management, and Elixir behaviours for extensibility (LLM providers and tools).

### Context

Need to establish clear architectural patterns that leverage Elixir's strengths while maintaining clean separation of concerns and extensibility.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional MVC with shared state**
   - Pros: Familiar pattern, simple to understand
   - Cons: Doesn't leverage OTP strengths, shared state creates bottlenecks

2. **Umbrella application architecture**
   - Pros: Strong compile-time boundaries, potential for separate deployment
   - Cons: Added complexity, harder tooling support, over-engineering for monolithic deployment

### Rationale

- Phoenix Contexts provide clean domain boundaries without compile-time overhead
- GenServer per session leverages OTP's core strength for isolated, fault-tolerant state
- Behaviours provide clean extensibility contracts similar to interfaces in other languages
- Supervision trees ensure automatic recovery from failures

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clean separation between web layer and business logic
- Fault-tolerant user sessions with automatic recovery
- Easy to add new LLM providers and tools through standardized contracts
- Leverages Elixir's unique strengths

**Negative:**
- Requires understanding of OTP concepts for effective development
- More complex than simple stateless architectures

## 2025-08-11: Authentication Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement configurable authentication supporting both single-user (development) and multi-user (production) modes with Google OAuth for web, device flow for CLI, and enterprise service accounts for Vertex AI.

### Context

Need to support different deployment scenarios from individual developers to enterprise teams while maintaining security best practices.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single authentication method (OAuth only)**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, consistent flow
   - Cons: Friction for individual developers, doesn't support enterprise use cases

2. **No authentication (open access)**
   - Pros: No complexity, fastest development
   - Cons: Security risks, no multi-user support, not production-ready

### Rationale

Flexibility is crucial for adoption across different use cases. Single-user mode removes friction for individual developers while multi-user mode enables team and enterprise deployment.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Supports wide range of deployment scenarios
- Removes barriers for individual developer adoption
- Enterprise-ready with proper authentication
- Flexible configuration based on deployment needs

**Negative:**
- Added complexity in implementation and testing
- Multiple authentication flows to maintain
- Configuration complexity for different deployment modes
