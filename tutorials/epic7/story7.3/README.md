# Epic 7 Story 7.3: Provider-Specific Prompt Optimization Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for the Provider-Specific Prompt Optimization system. This tutorial will guide you through understanding, implementing, and using the advanced prompt optimization capabilities built into The Maestro.

## What You'll Learn

- **Provider-Specific Optimization**: How to leverage unique capabilities of Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT
- **Adaptive Learning**: How the system learns from interactions to improve over time
- **Performance Monitoring**: How to track and analyze optimization effectiveness
- **Configuration Management**: How to fine-tune optimization settings for your needs

## System Overview

The Provider-Specific Prompt Optimization system intelligently adapts prompts based on the strengths and characteristics of different AI providers:

```
Original Prompt ‚Üí Provider Detection ‚Üí Optimization Engine ‚Üí Enhanced Prompt
                                            ‚Üì
                Performance Tracking ‚Üê Response Analysis ‚Üê AI Response
```

### Key Components

1. **Provider Optimizer** - Main coordination engine
2. **Provider-Specific Optimizers** - Anthropic, Google, OpenAI specialists  
3. **Adaptive Learning System** - Pattern recognition and strategy adaptation
4. **Monitoring & Analytics** - Performance tracking and regression detection
5. **Configuration Management** - Dynamic settings and runtime updates

## Provider Capabilities Overview

### Anthropic (Claude)
- **Strengths**: Reasoning, code understanding, large context, safety awareness
- **Optimizations**: Structured thinking, reasoning frameworks, context navigation
- **Best For**: Complex analysis, code review, ethical reasoning, large document processing

### Google (Gemini)  
- **Strengths**: Multimodal processing, function calling, code generation, integration
- **Optimizations**: Visual reasoning, tool orchestration, service integration
- **Best For**: Multimodal tasks, API integration, visual analysis, code generation

### OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- **Strengths**: General reasoning, consistency, creativity, structured output
- **Optimizations**: Output formatting, consistency checks, token efficiency
- **Best For**: Creative tasks, consistent formatting, general-purpose applications

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```elixir
# Basic optimization for a specific provider
{:ok, optimized_context} = ProviderOptimizer.optimize_for_provider(
  enhanced_prompt,
  %{provider: :anthropic, model: "claude-3-5-sonnet"},
  %{quality: true, reasoning_enhancement: true}
)
```

### Integration with Enhancement Pipeline

```elixir
# Enhanced pipeline with provider optimization
{:ok, result} = Pipeline.enhance_prompt_with_provider(
  "Analyze this complex system architecture",
  user_context,
  %{provider: :anthropic, model: "claude-3-5-sonnet"}
)
```

### Performance Benchmarking

```elixir
# Run quick benchmark
results = BenchmarkRunner.run_quick_benchmark()

# Run provider-specific benchmark  
results = BenchmarkRunner.run_provider_benchmark(:anthropic)

# Full comprehensive benchmark
results = PerformanceBenchmark.run_comprehensive_benchmark()
```

## Configuration

### Provider-Specific Settings

```elixir
config :the_maestro, :prompt_optimization,
  anthropic: %{
    max_context_utilization: 0.9,
    reasoning_enhancement: true,
    structured_thinking: true,
    safety_optimization: true
  },
  google: %{
    multimodal_optimization: true,
    function_calling_enhancement: true,
    large_context_utilization: 0.85,
    integration_optimization: true
  },
  openai: %{
    consistency_optimization: true,
    structured_output_enhancement: true,
    token_efficiency_priority: :high,
    reliability_optimization: true
  }
```
