# The Maestro - Tutorials

Welcome to The Maestro tutorial collection! These educational tutorials are designed to teach intermediate Elixir developers how the features in The Maestro were built, styled like blog posts with code snippets and explanations.

## Overview

The Maestro is an Elixir-based AI agent replication system that demonstrates advanced OTP patterns, fault-tolerant architecture, and modern Phoenix development practices. Each tutorial corresponds to a specific story in our development process and teaches the concepts and techniques used to build that feature.

## How to Use These Tutorials

- **Prerequisites**: Intermediate knowledge of Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix
- **Structure**: Each tutorial includes theory, implementation details, and practical examples
- **Code Examples**: All code is tested and taken directly from the working application
- **Progressive Complexity**: Tutorials build upon previous concepts

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Agent Engine

Learn the foundational concepts and build the core agent engine that powers The Maestro.
