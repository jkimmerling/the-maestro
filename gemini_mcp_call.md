Of course. Based on the provided context and my understanding of the Gemini API and Model-Context-Protocol (MCP), here is a deep dive into the exact structure of the back-and-forth communication when Gemini CLI uses a tool via the `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal` endpoint.

This is a research-only explanation of the process. No code will be changed.

### High-Level Overview

The entire process is a multi-step conversation between the Gemini CLI (the client) and the Gemini model (the server). The model doesn't execute tools itself; it tells the client *which* tool to execute and with *what* arguments. The client then executes the tool, gets the result, and sends it back to the model to inform the final answer.

Let's walk through your example: asking for docs using a `context7` MCP tool. This is a great example because it's a two-step tool call: `resolve_library_id` followed by `get_library_docs`.

---

### Step 1: User's Initial Prompt

The user initiates the request.

```bash
gemini "show me the latest docs for next.js on routing"
```

### Step 2: First Request (Gemini CLI -> Google API)

The Gemini CLI constructs a `streamGenerateContent` request to the Google API endpoint. The key is the `toolConfig` section, where the CLI declares all the tools it has available for the model to use.

**Endpoint:** `POST https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro:streamGenerateContent`

**Request Body (Simplified JSON Structure):**

```json
{
  "contents": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [
        { "text": "show me the latest docs for next.js on routing" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "toolConfig": {
    "functionDeclarations": [
      {
        "name": "resolve_library_id",
        "description": "Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID...",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "OBJECT",
          "properties": {
            "libraryName": { "type": "STRING" }
          },
          "required": ["libraryName"]
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "get_library_docs",
        "description": "Fetches up-to-date documentation for a library...",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "OBJECT",
          "properties": {
            "context7CompatibleLibraryID": { "type": "STRING" },
            "topic": { "type": "STRING" },
            "tokens": { "type": "NUMBER" }
          },
          "required": ["context7CompatibleLibraryID"]
        }
      }
      // ... other tool definitions like read_file, run_shell_command, etc.
    ]
  },
  "generationConfig": {
    // ... temperature, maxOutputTokens, etc.
  }
}
```

### Step 3: First Response (Google API -> Gemini CLI) - The Tool Call

The model receives the request and the list of available tools. It determines that it cannot answer the question directly and needs to use a tool. It sees that `resolve_library_id` is the first step. It responds not with text, but with a `functionCall`.

**Response Body (Simplified JSON Structure):**

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "content": {
        "role": "model",
        "parts": [
          {
            "functionCall": {
              "name": "resolve_library_id",
              "args": {
                "libraryName": "next.js"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
  // ... other metadata
}
```
*The CLI does not show this to the user. It sees the `functionCall` and knows it has work to do.*

### Step 4: Second Request (Gemini CLI -> Google API) - The Tool Result

The Gemini CLI receives the `functionCall`, finds the tool named `resolve_library_id` in its internal registry, and executes it with the argument `{"libraryName": "next.js"}`.

Let's say the tool executes and returns the ID `/vercel/next.js`.

The CLI now constructs a *new* request to send back to the model. This request includes the entire conversation history so far, plus the result of the tool execution. The tool result is passed in a special `tool` role.

**Request Body (Simplified JSON Structure):**

```json
{
  "contents": [
    // 1. Original user prompt
    {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [
        { "text": "show me the latest docs for next.js on routing" }
      ]
    },
    // 2. Model's first response (the tool call)
    {
      "role": "model",
      "parts": [
        {
          "functionCall": {
            "name": "resolve_library_id",
            "args": { "libraryName": "next.js" }
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    // 3. The result of the client executing that tool call
    {
      "role": "tool",
      "parts": [
        {
          "functionResponse": {
            "name": "resolve_library_id",
            "response": {
              "result": "Found library ID: /vercel/next.js" // This is the stdout of the tool
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "toolConfig": {
    // ... The same tool definitions are sent again
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Second Response (Google API -> Gemini CLI) - Another Tool Call

The model receives this updated history. It now knows the library ID is `/vercel/next.js`. However, it still doesn't have the documentation. It looks at the available tools again and decides it needs to call `get_library_docs`.

**Response Body (Simplified JSON Structure):**

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "content": {
        "role": "model",
        "parts": [
          {
            "functionCall": {
              "name": "get_library_docs",
              "args": {
                "context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/vercel/next.js",
                "topic": "routing"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 6: Third Request (Gemini CLI -> Google API) - Final Tool Result

The CLI again receives this `functionCall`, executes the `get_library_docs` tool with the provided arguments, and gets the documentation text as a result.

It then sends a final request, containing the full history plus the result of this second tool call.

**Request Body (Simplified JSON Structure):**
This `contents` array is now even longer, containing the full back-and-forth from Step 4, plus the new `functionCall` and `functionResponse`.

```json
{
  "contents": [
    // ... all 3 previous messages from Step 4 ...
    {
      "role": "model",
      "parts": [
        {
          "functionCall": {
            "name": "get_library_docs",
            "args": {
              "context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/vercel/next.js",
              "topic": "routing"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "tool",
      "parts": [
        {
          "functionResponse": {
            "name": "get_library_docs",
            "response": {
              // The actual documentation text would be here
              "result": "Routing in Next.js is based on the file system..."
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "toolConfig": {
    // ... tools sent again ...
  }
}
```

### Step 7: Final Response (Google API -> Gemini CLI) - The User-Facing Answer

The model now has the user's original question and all the information it needs from the tools. It synthesizes this into a natural language answer and sends it back as a final `text` part.

**Response Body (Simplified JSON Structure):**

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "content": {
        "role": "model",
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Okay, here is the latest documentation for Next.js regarding routing: Routing in Next.js is based on the file system..."
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The Gemini CLI receives this, sees the `text` part, and streams the response to the user's terminal.
