# - Save and restore conversation sessions through the UI
# - Switch between LLM providers dynamically
```

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

#### **No LLM Providers Available**
```bash
# Ensure at least one API key is set
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY  
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

#### **Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
mix ecto.migrate
mix ecto.setup  # If database doesn't exist
```

#### **Shell Tool Not Working**
```bash
# Ensure Docker is available
docker --version
# Check shell tool configuration in config/dev.exs
```

#### **API Call Failures**
```bash
# Check network connectivity
curl -I https://httpbin.org/get
# Verify OpenAPI specification format
```
