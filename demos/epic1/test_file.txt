Hello from Epic 1 Demo!

This is a test file that demonstrates the file reading capability
of The Maestro AI agent system.

Epic 1 has successfully implemented:
- Core OTP application with supervision tree
- Agent GenServer with state management
- LLMProvider behavior with Gemini adapter
- OAuth authentication for Gemini API
- Tooling DSL with sandboxed file operations

The agent can now read files like this one and interact with
external LLM providers to provide intelligent responses.
