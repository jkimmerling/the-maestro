# The web interface provides access to all demonstrated capabilities:
# - Send messages using any configured LLM provider
# - Switch between providers dynamically during conversations
# - View real-time model performance metrics
# - Access provider authentication status
# - Save and restore conversation sessions
```

### Troubleshooting

#### **No Providers Configured**
```bash
# Ensure at least one API key is set
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY  
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY

# If no keys are set, the demo will run in validation mode
# with limited functionality but full system testing
```

#### **Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Run migrations if needed
mix ecto.migrate

# Reset database if corrupted
mix ecto.reset
```

#### **Authentication Failures**
```bash
# Verify API key format and validity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.anthropic.com/v1/models

# Check environment variable export
env | grep API_KEY
```

#### **Demo Startup Issues**
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are compiled
mix deps.get
mix compile

# Check for compilation errors
mix compile --warnings-as-errors
```
