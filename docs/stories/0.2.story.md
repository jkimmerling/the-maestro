# Story 0.2: HTTP Client Standardization (Req Migration)

## Status
**Approved - Epic 0 HTTP Unification Story**

## Implementation Source (10000% Working Code)
- Canonical reference: `/Users/jasonk/Development/the_maestro/source/codex`
- All Req patterns, streaming adapters, and examples MUST be adapted from the above source to ensure 10000% working behavior.

## Plan Alignment
- This story follows `docs/prd/EMERGENCY-COURSE-CORRECT-PRD-gpt.md` (GPT variant). Keep streaming, HTTP, and E2E scope consistent with the PRD.

## Story
**As the system,**
**I want** unified HTTP client implementation using Req for all provider operations, OAuth flows, and streaming requests,
**so that** I can eliminate the complexity of multiple HTTP clients (Tesla, HTTPoison) and provide consistent request/response handling across all LLM provider integrations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-TYPES: Types/Specs/Structs Required
1. All public functions in the Req client factory and streaming adapter include explicit `@spec` annotations.
2. Any complex request/response payloads are modeled as typed structs with `@typedoc`, `@type t`, and `@enforce_keys` where appropriate.
3. No ad-hoc maps are accepted/returned by public APIs; use structs for cross-module interfaces.
4. Add type aliases for provider credentials and request options; reuse consistently.
5. Dialyzer and Credo must pass with zero warnings related to specs or types.

### AC-1: Complete Req Migration
1. All HTTP operations across the system use Req as the unified HTTP client.
2. Tesla and HTTPoison dependencies are completely removed from the application.
3. Provider modules perform all HTTP operations using Req with consistent patterns.
4. OAuth flows for all providers use Req for authorization and token exchange operations.

### AC-2: Unified Streaming Architecture
1. All streaming responses are processed through a unified SSE adapter using Req streaming capabilities.
2. The streaming adapter converts Req streaming responses into events compatible with `TheMaestro.Streaming.parse_stream/3`.
3. All providers use the same streaming interface regardless of their underlying streaming format.
4. Streaming interruption and error recovery work consistently across all providers.

### AC-3: Provider-Specific Client Factories
1. Each provider has a dedicated Req client factory with provider-specific configuration.
2. Client factories handle provider-specific headers, authentication, retry policies, and logging.
3. Base URLs, timeouts, and other provider-specific settings are centralized in client factories.
4. Client creation is optimized with connection pooling using existing Finch infrastructure.

### AC-4: Backwards Compatibility During Migration
1. Existing functionality continues working during the Req migration process.
2. Gradual migration path allows provider-by-provider transition without system disruption.
3. Rollback capability exists at each migration stage for safety.
4. All existing tests continue passing throughout the migration process.

## Dev Notes

### HTTP Client Architecture Context

**Current State Analysis:**
[Source: TheMaestro system architecture analysis]
The current system uses multiple HTTP clients creating complexity and maintenance overhead:

1. **Tesla Client**: Used for general provider API requests with Finch adapter
2. **HTTPoison**: Used specifically for OAuth token requests
3. **Finch**: Connection pooling for Tesla, separate from OAuth requests

**Target Architecture with Req:**
Req provides a unified HTTP client that can replace both Tesla and HTTPoison while maintaining Finch connection pooling:

1. **Unified Client**: Single HTTP client for all operations (API, OAuth, streaming)
2. **Finch Integration**: Req uses Finch automatically for connection pooling
3. **Streaming Support**: Native streaming capabilities eliminate need for custom adapters
4. **Plugin System**: Comprehensive middleware system for authentication, logging, retry

### Req Migration Strategy

**Migration Approach:**
[Source: GPT PRD File-Level Mapping for migration planning]
The migration follows a provider-by-provider approach to minimize risk:

— 2025-08-31 (progress)
- Implemented Req client factory (`lib/the_maestro/providers/http/req_client_factory.ex`) using Finch pools per provider; ensured exact header ordering for Anthropic and OpenAI; added tests under `test/the_maestro/providers/http/req_client_factory_test.exs`.
- Added streaming adapter scaffold (`lib/the_maestro/providers/http/streaming_adapter.ex`) with SSE parsing helpers; `stream_request/2` to be wired with Req streaming in provider stories.
- Replaced Tesla client tests with Req-based tests focused on header order, base URL, and pool selection; kept Provider/Streaming tests green.
- Not done yet: OAuth Bearer injection and session-based credential retrieval (will integrate with named sessions work), global Req defaults, and provider streaming integration.

- Story maintenance: Verified active branch `story/0.2-req-migration` and clean working tree; marked completed subtasks in this story file and added notes for next steps. Prepared to align branch naming conventions for any sub-branches if needed.

### Dev Notes – Task 1.1 Global Configuration

- Implemented centralized Req base options in `lib/the_maestro/providers/http/req_config.ex` with conservative retry defaults; providers inherit via `ReqConfig.merge_with_base/1`.
- Updated `ReqClientFactory` to build requests using `ReqConfig` base options and provider pool/base_url/headers.
- Finch pools remain provider-specific (`:anthropic_finch`, `:openai_finch`, `:gemini_finch`) and are injected by the factory by default.
- Added default timeouts in `ReqConfig`: `receive_timeout: 60_000`. Logging to be handled at provider call sites or via telemetry; current Story scope focuses on retries/timeouts + pooling.

### Archon Research

- Attempted Archon usage but local `archon` CLI not found in PATH. Prepared queries (pending execution when available):
  - `archon:perform_rag_query(query="Elixir Req best practices patterns", match_count=3)`
  - `archon:search_code_examples(query="Elixir Req retry and timeout examples", match_count=3)`
  - `archon:search_code_examples(query="Elixir Req + Finch pool configuration examples", match_count=3)`
  Results will be summarized here and used to tune retry/timeout/logging defaults.

### Dev Notes – Task 1.2 Base Req Client Factory

- Added OAuth Bearer injection to `ReqClientFactory` for Anthropic and OpenAI, with optional named session selection via `session: "name"`.
- OAuth headers:
  - Anthropic (OAuth): `authorization: Bearer [token]`, `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`, `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`, plus standard UA/accept/client-version.
  - OpenAI (OAuth): `authorization: Bearer [token]`, optional `openai-organization` (from runtime config) + standard UA/accept/client-version.
- Added safety checks for token presence and expiry (`:expired` error when `expires_at` <= now). Returns `:not_found` if no saved OAuth credentials are available.

### Dev Notes – Task 2.2 Provider Streaming Integration

- Implemented `stream_chat/3` in Anthropic and OpenAI streaming modules to build Req clients via `ReqClientFactory` and route calls through `StreamingAdapter.stream_request/2`.
- Current `StreamingAdapter.stream_request/2` returns an empty stream placeholder until live streaming hookup is finalized; this allows provider code paths to be connected without breaking tests.
- Request bodies follow provider patterns: `model`, `messages`, `stream: true`; endpoints `/v1/messages` (Anthropic) and `/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI).

### Dev Notes – Task 3.1 OAuth Flow Standardization

- Migrated OAuth token exchange (Anthropic + OpenAI) from HTTPoison to Req while preserving error semantics:
  - Anthropic: JSON requests to token endpoint with PKCE. Uses `:anthropic_finch` pool.
  - OpenAI: Form-encoded requests to token endpoint with PKCE. Uses `:openai_finch` pool.
- Migrated Anthropic OAuth refresh in `TokenRefreshWorker` to Req. Refactored for readability and reduced nesting per Credo.

1. **Infrastructure First**: Establish Req client factory and streaming adapter
2. **OAuth Migration**: Move OAuth flows to Req while maintaining exact compatibility
3. **API Migration**: Convert API operations provider by provider
4. **Legacy Removal**: Remove old HTTP clients after full validation

**Backwards Compatibility Preservation:**
During migration, multiple strategies ensure continuous operation:
1. **Gradual Replacement**: Replace HTTP client usage incrementally
2. **Testing Validation**: All existing tests continue passing during migration
3. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert to previous HTTP client at any stage
4. **Monitoring**: Track performance and error rates during migration

### Req Client Factory Design

**Provider-Specific Configuration Patterns:**
```elixir
defmodule TheMaestro.Providers.Http.ReqClientFactory do
  @base_req_config [
    finch: TheMaestro.Finch,
    retry: :transient,
    retry_delay: &ExponentialBackoff.exponential_backoff/1,
    max_retries: 3
  ]

  def create_client(:anthropic, auth_type, opts) do
    credentials = get_credentials(:anthropic, auth_type, opts)
    
    Req.new(@base_req_config)
    |> Req.Request.put_base_url("https://api.anthropic.com")
    |> add_anthropic_headers(credentials)
    |> configure_anthropic_retry_policy()
    |> add_logging("anthropic")
  end

  def create_client(:openai, auth_type, opts) do
    credentials = get_credentials(:openai, auth_type, opts)
    base_url = determine_openai_endpoint(auth_type, credentials)
    
    Req.new(@base_req_config)
    |> Req.Request.put_base_url(base_url)
    |> add_openai_headers(credentials)
    |> configure_openai_retry_policy()
    |> add_logging("openai")
  end
end
```

### Streaming Architecture Integration

**Req Streaming Adapter Design:**
[Source: Existing TheMaestro.Streaming architecture analysis]
The streaming adapter integrates Req streaming with existing streaming handlers:

```elixir
defmodule TheMaestro.Providers.Http.StreamingAdapter do
  def stream_request(req_client, opts \\ []) do
    req_client
    |> Req.Request.put_header("accept", "text/event-stream")
    |> Req.Request.put_header("cache-control", "no-cache")
    |> Req.stream(into: :self)
    |> case do
      {:ok, response} -> 
        {:ok, convert_to_sse_stream(response.body)}
      {:error, reason} -> 
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end
  
  defp convert_to_sse_stream(req_stream) do
    req_stream
    |> Stream.flat_map(&parse_sse_chunk/1)
    |> Stream.reject(&is_nil/1)
    |> Stream.map(&format_for_streaming_parser/1)
  end
end
```

### Provider-Specific Migration Considerations

**Anthropic Migration Specifics:**
[Source: Story 1.4 implementation details]
Anthropic uses specific header requirements and JSON request formats:

1. **Headers**: Exact ordering of `x-api-key`, `anthropic-version`, `anthropic-beta`
2. **OAuth Format**: JSON request body for token exchange (not form-encoded)
3. **Manual Flow**: Code paste pattern without callback server
4. **Streaming**: MessageStreamEvent format through existing handler

**OpenAI Migration Specifics:**
[Source: Story 1.6 implementation details and Codex CLI analysis]
OpenAI has complex dual-mode requirements:

1. **Dual Endpoints**: ChatGPT backend vs OpenAI API based on account type
2. **Parameter Ordering**: Exact URL parameter order for OAuth compatibility
3. **Account Detection**: ID token analysis to determine account type
4. **Two-Stage OAuth**: Standard OAuth followed by API key token exchange

**Gemini Migration Preparation:**
[Source: Limited existing Gemini implementation]
Gemini currently has minimal implementation requiring research:

1. **API Key Only**: Current implementation only supports API key authentication
2. **Google OAuth Research**: Need to research Google OAuth patterns for Gemini
3. **Streaming Handler**: Existing handler works with current implementation
4. **Model Listing**: Not currently implemented, needs addition

### Security and Authentication Patterns

**Authentication Migration Strategy:**
[Source: docs/architecture/security-architecture.md principles]
Security remains paramount during HTTP client migration:

1. **Credential Handling**: Same encrypted storage, different HTTP client
2. **OAuth Security**: Maintain PKCE implementation with Req
3. **Token Refresh**: Background worker continues using new Req client
4. **Session Management**: Named sessions work with new HTTP client

**Security Validation Requirements:**
1. **Encryption Preservation**: All authentication data remains encrypted
2. **PKCE Compliance**: OAuth flows maintain PKCE security standards
3. **Token Security**: No token exposure in logs during HTTP client migration
4. **Session Isolation**: Named sessions maintain security boundaries

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Optimization with Req:**
Req provides several performance advantages over current multi-client approach:

1. **Connection Reuse**: Better connection pooling through Finch integration
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: Single HTTP client reduces memory usage
3. **Streaming Efficiency**: Native streaming support reduces memory copying
4. **Request Pipeline**: Efficient request/response processing pipeline

**Performance Validation Requirements:**
1. **Latency**: API request latency should not increase with Req migration
2. **Memory Usage**: Total memory usage should decrease with single HTTP client
3. **Connection Pooling**: Connection efficiency should improve with unified client
4. **Streaming Performance**: Streaming latency should remain similar or improve

### Testing Strategy and Validation

**HTTP Client Testing Approach:**
[Source: docs/standards/testing-strategies.md and existing test patterns]
Testing strategy ensures migration safety and correctness:

**Unit Testing Requirements:**
1. **Client Factory Testing**: All provider client factories create proper Req clients
2. **Authentication Testing**: All authentication patterns work with Req
3. **Streaming Testing**: Streaming adapter properly converts Req streams
4. **Error Handling**: All error conditions handled properly with Req

**Integration Testing Requirements:**
1. **OAuth Flow Testing**: Complete OAuth flows work with Req for all providers
2. **API Operation Testing**: All API operations maintain functionality with Req
3. **Streaming Integration**: Streaming works end-to-end with new adapter
4. **Performance Testing**: Performance remains acceptable with Req

**Manual Testing Protocol:**
Following established manual testing patterns:
1. **Real Provider Testing**: Test with actual provider OAuth and API endpoints
2. **Streaming Validation**: Manual validation of streaming functionality
3. **Error Condition Testing**: Test error handling with real network conditions
4. **Performance Validation**: Manual performance testing with real workloads

### Quality Gates and Acceptance

**Implementation Quality Standards:**
1. **Code Quality**: All code passes `mix format` and `mix credo --strict`
2. **Documentation**: Complete @spec declarations and comprehensive documentation
3. **Test Coverage**: >90% test coverage for all HTTP client code
4. **Integration Validation**: All existing functionality preserved during migration

**Migration Safety Criteria:**
1. **Functionality Preservation**: All existing features work identically with Req
2. **Performance Maintenance**: Performance remains at least equivalent to current implementation  
3. **Error Handling**: Error conditions handled identically or better with Req
4. **Security Preservation**: All security measures maintained during migration
