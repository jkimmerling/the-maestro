# 8. Dependencies & Assumptions

**Goal:** Document external dependencies and underlying assumptions that could impact project success.

## **External Dependencies**

### **Critical Dependencies**

- **Provider API Availability:**
    
    - Anthropic Claude API (api.anthropic.com)
        
    - OpenAI API (api.openai.com)
        
    - Google Generative AI API (generativelanguage.googleapis.com)
        
    - **Risk:** Service outages or API changes could break functionality
        
- **OAuth Approval Process:**
    
    - Anthropic OAuth application approval
        
    - OpenAI OAuth application approval
        
    - Google Cloud Console OAuth setup
        
    - **Risk:** Approval delays could impact timeline by 2-4 weeks
        

### **Technical Dependencies**

- **Infrastructure:**
    
    - PostgreSQL database server
        
    - Redis server for session state management
        
    - Elixir/Erlang runtime environment
        
- **Third-Party Libraries:**
    
    - Phoenix LiveView for real-time web UI
        
    - Tesla HTTP client for API communication
        
    - Oban for background job processing
        
    - Ratatouille for TUI construction
        
    - Burrito for executable packaging
        

## **Key Assumptions**

### **Technical Assumptions**

- **API Stability:** Provider APIs will maintain backward compatibility during development period
    
- **Rate Limits:** Current provider rate limits will accommodate development and testing needs
    
- **Authentication Methods:** All providers will continue supporting both API key and OAuth authentication
    
- **Streaming Support:** All target providers support server-sent events or similar streaming protocols
    

### **User Assumptions**

- **Single-User Focus:** Target user (Alex) prefers power/flexibility over security restrictions
    
- **Technical Proficiency:** User is comfortable with command-line tools and technical configuration
    
- **Development Workflow:** User's primary use case is software development with file system access needs
    
- **Provider Selection:** User wants choice between providers based on task suitability, not cost optimization
    

### **Business Assumptions**

- **Personal Use:** System designed for single-user, personal use rather than team collaboration
    
- **Self-Hosted:** User prefers self-hosted solution over SaaS offering
    
- **Integration Priority:** Direct API integration preferred over web scraping or unofficial methods
    

## **Assumption Validation Plans**

- **Technical Validation:** Create proof-of-concept implementations for each provider during Week 1
    
- **User Validation:** Regular check-ins with target persona (Alex) throughout development
    
- **API Validation:** Maintain automated tests against all provider APIs to detect changes early
