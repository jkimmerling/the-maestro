# 1. Introduction & Goals

**Product Name:** The Maestro

**Introduction:** The Maestro is a specialized, single-user LLM orchestration platform designed to function as a personal AI agent development team. It provides a unified interface, accessible via both a web UI and a terminal UI (TUI), for managing multiple concurrent LLM sessions across different providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini). The core purpose is to empower a solo developer to leverage a team of AI agents that can collaborate on coding projects with extensive access to tools, files, and custom contexts.

**Project Goals:**

- **Goal 1: Unify Multi-Provider Agents:** Create a single application to run and manage concurrent sessions with models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini, enabling them to work in concert.
    
- **Goal 2: Achieve Exact API Fidelity:** Ensure all authentication and API communication with providers _exactly_ mimics the behavior of the `llxprt` and `gemini-cli` reference applications, down to the order of headers.
    
- **Goal 3: Provide Powerful Tooling:** Equip LLM agents with a comprehensive and unrestricted set of tools, including file system access, code execution, and the ability to use other agents as sub-agents.
    
- **Goal 4: Enable Deep Customization:** Allow for dynamic, on-the-fly configuration of each agent session, including system prompts, personas, working directories, and available tools.
    
- **Goal 5: Offer Dual Interfaces:** Deliver a rich, real-time web interface using Phoenix LiveView and a separate, standalone TUI client for flexible interaction.
