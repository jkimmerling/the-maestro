# 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**Goal:** Identify potential project risks and establish mitigation strategies.

## **High-Impact Risks**

### **1. Provider API Changes/Deprecation**

- **Risk Level:** HIGH
    
- **Impact:** Could break authentication or streaming functionality
    
- **Probability:** Medium (providers frequently update APIs)
    
- **Mitigation:**
    
    - Implement comprehensive API monitoring and alerting
        
    - Maintain multiple authentication methods per provider
        
    - Create API compatibility test suite with daily execution
        
    - Establish direct communication channels with provider developer relations teams
        

### **2. OAuth Approval Delays**

- **Risk Level:** HIGH
    
- **Impact:** Could delay Phase 1 by 2-4 weeks
    
- **Probability:** Medium (OAuth apps require manual approval)
    
- **Mitigation:**
    
    - Submit OAuth applications immediately upon project start
        
    - Develop with API keys first, add OAuth as secondary implementation
        
    - Prepare detailed OAuth application documentation highlighting security measures
        
    - Have backup authentication strategies ready
        

### **3. Performance Under Load**

- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
    
- **Impact:** Poor user experience with multiple concurrent sessions
    
- **Probability:** Medium (Elixir/Phoenix handles concurrency well, but LLM APIs may be slow)
    
- **Mitigation:**
    
    - Implement connection pooling and request queuing
        
    - Add session-level resource limits and monitoring
        
    - Design asynchronous message handling from the start
        
    - Include load testing in Phase 3
        

## **Medium-Impact Risks**

### **4. MCP Server Integration Complexity**

- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
    
- **Impact:** May delay Epic 3 or reduce MCP functionality
    
- **Probability:** Medium (MCP is relatively new protocol)
    
- **Mitigation:**
    
    - Start MCP integration early in Phase 2
        
    - Create MCP server mocking for development
        
    - Focus on 2-3 high-value MCP servers initially
        
    - Design MCP integration as optional/pluggable feature
        

### **5. Token Counting Accuracy**

- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
    
- **Impact:** Inaccurate cost tracking and billing estimation
    
- **Probability:** Low (provider APIs generally include usage data)
    
- **Mitigation:**
    
    - Implement multiple token counting methods (API-provided + local estimation)
        
    - Regular validation against provider billing data
        
    - Conservative cost estimation as default
        
    - User-configurable cost limits and alerts
        

## **Low-Impact Risks**

### **6. Database Migration Issues**

- **Risk Level:** LOW
    
- **Impact:** Development delays during schema changes
    
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive migration testing and rollback procedures
    

### **7. TUI Cross-Platform Compatibility**

- **Risk Level:** LOW
    
- **Impact:** Limited platform support for standalone executable
    
- **Mitigation:** Focus on primary platform (macOS/Linux), add Windows support in future iteration
