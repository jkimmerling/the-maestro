# 2. The Problem & The User

### **Problem Statement**

A solo developer managing complex software projects lacks the tooling to efficiently orchestrate multiple, specialized AI agents as a cohesive development team. Interacting with LLMs through separate, isolated chat interfaces is fragmented and manually intensive. There is no unified platform that allows a developer to run concurrent sessions across different providers, grant them direct access to a project's files and tools, and manage their context dynamically. This fragmentation prevents the developer from truly leveraging AI as a force multiplier and a collaborative coding partner.

### **User Personas**

This platform is built for a single, specific user type:

- **Persona:** Alex, the Power Developer
    
- **Role:** Solo Technical Founder / Principal Engineer
    
- **Description:** Alex is a highly skilled developer building a sophisticated application using Elixir. As a solo operator, they handle everything from architecture and backend development to frontend and TUI implementation. Alex is not looking for a simple AI assistant; they need a command center to build and direct their own team of specialized AI agents.
    
- **Needs & Goals:**
    
    - To augment their workflow by offloading coding, research, and documentation tasks to a team of AI agents.
        
    - To maintain full control over the agents' environment, including file access, available tools, and dynamic system prompts.
        
    - To use the best model for the job (e.g., Claude for code generation, Gemini for research) within a single, unified project context.
        
    - To have flexible access to the system through either a powerful web UI or a fast, keyboard-driven TUI.
        
    - To prioritize power and flexibility over restrictive security measures; the agents should have the same level of access as Alex does.
