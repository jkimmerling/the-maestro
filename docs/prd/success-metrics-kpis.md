# 5. Success Metrics & KPIs

**Goal:** Define measurable criteria for project success and ongoing performance monitoring.

## **Primary Success Metrics**

- **Technical Performance:**
    
    - **API Fidelity:** 100% compatibility with `llxprt` and `gemini-cli` reference implementations (verified through automated header/response comparison tests)
        
    - **System Reliability:** 99.5% uptime for web interface, <2 second response time for API calls
        
    - **Multi-Provider Support:** Successfully authenticate and maintain concurrent sessions with all 3 providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini)
        
- **User Experience:**
    
    - **Session Management:** Support for minimum 10 concurrent agent sessions without performance degradation
        
    - **Tool Integration:** 95% success rate for file operations, code execution, and MCP server interactions
        
    - **Interface Responsiveness:** Web UI real-time updates <500ms latency, TUI keyboard response <100ms
        

## **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

- **Functionality KPIs:**
    
    - **Authentication Success Rate:** >99% for both API key and OAuth flows
        
    - **Message Delivery:** 100% message persistence and retrieval accuracy
        
    - **Token Tracking Accuracy:** <5% variance between tracked and actual provider-reported token usage
        
- **Quality KPIs:**
    
    - **Code Coverage:** >90% for critical paths (authentication, session management, tool execution)
        
    - **Error Rate:** <1% for core operations (session creation, message sending, tool execution)
        
    - **Data Integrity:** 100% accuracy in conversation history and session state persistence
        

## **Success Validation Criteria**

- **MVP Success:** Alex (target persona) can successfully run 3+ concurrent sessions across different providers, execute file operations and code, and switch seamlessly between web UI and TUI
    
- **Production Ready:** System handles 20+ concurrent sessions, integrates with 5+ MCP servers, and maintains <2 second response times under load
    
- **Long-term Success:** Platform becomes Alex's primary development interface, replacing isolated AI chat tools, with measurable productivity gains in coding tasks
