# Coding Standards

## Overview

This document consolidates coding standards, development best practices, and quality requirements for the Cleanops CRM project. These standards ensure code consistency, maintainability, and quality across the development team.

## Quality Standards


### Automated Enforcement

All code changes must pass:

1. **Unit test coverage**: minimum 80%
2. **Integration test coverage**: minimum 70%
3. **Security scan**: zero critical vulnerabilities
4. **Code complexity**: maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10
5. **Performance**: response time < 200ms for API calls

### Sub-agent Validation

Required approvals before merge:
- `code-reviewer`: PASS (no critical issues)
- `test-automator`: PASS (comprehensive coverage)
- `qa-expert`: PASS (strategy validated)

### Exemption Process

Exemptions require:
- Technical justification in `decisions.md`
- Alternative mitigation strategies
- Time-bound remediation plan

## General Formatting

### Indentation
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (never tabs)
- Maintain consistent indentation throughout files
- Align nested structures for readability

### Naming Conventions
- **Methods and Variables**: Use snake_case (e.g., `user_profile`, `calculate_total`)
- **Classes and Modules**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`, `PaymentProcessor`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)

### String Formatting
- Use single quotes for strings: `'Hello World'`
- Use double quotes only when interpolation is needed
- Use template literals for multi-line strings or complex interpolation

### Code Comments
- Add brief comments above non-obvious business logic
- Document complex algorithms or calculations
- Explain the "why" behind implementation choices
- Never remove existing comments unless removing the associated code
- Update comments when modifying code to maintain accuracy
- Keep comments concise and relevant

## Elixir Style Guide

### Automatic Formatting
- **MANDATORY**: Use `mix format` for all Elixir files
- Configure `.formatter.exs` in project root
- Integrate format-on-save in your editor
- Run `mix format --check-formatted` in CI/CD

### Naming Conventions
- **Functions and Variables**: snake_case (`user_name`, `calculate_total`)
- **Modules**: CamelCase (`MyApp.UserService`, `HTTPClient`)
- **Atoms**: snake_case (`:user_name`, `:ok`, `:error`)
- **Boolean Functions**: 
  - Suffix with `?` for general booleans (`valid?`, `empty?`)
  - Prefix with `is_` for guard-safe functions (`is_list`, `is_atom`)
- **Exception Functions**: Suffix with `!` (`File.read!`, `String.to_integer!`)

### String Formatting
- **Prefer double quotes** for strings: `"Hello World"`
- Use single quotes only for charlists when needed
- Use sigils for special string types (`~s`, `~r`, etc.)
- Use interpolation with `#{}`: `"Hello #{name}"`

### Function Definitions
- Always use parentheses when functions have arguments: `def hello(name)`
- Omit parentheses only for zero-argument functions: `def hello`
- Use `do:` syntax for single-line functions: `def add(a, b), do: a + b`

### Pipe Operator (|>)
- Use for chaining 2 or more functions
- Start pipeline with a variable, not a function call
- Avoid for single function calls

```elixir
# Good
data
|> String.trim()
|> String.downcase()
|> String.split()

# Avoid
data |> String.trim()  # single call
String.trim(data) |> String.downcase()  # starts with function
```

### Module Structure (in order)
1. `@moduledoc`
2. `@behaviour`
3. `use`
4. `import`
5. `alias`
6. `require`
7. `@module_attribute`
8. `defstruct`
9. `@type` / `@spec`
10. Public functions (`def`)
11. Private functions (`defp`)

### Comments and Documentation
- Use `@moduledoc` and `@doc` for public API documentation
- Use `#` comments only for implementation details
- Write `@spec` for all public functions
- Include examples in `@doc` that work as doctests

## Development Best Practices

### CRITICAL: Git Workflow Requirements

**VERY IMPORTANT** - These practices are mandatory for all development work:

#### Branch Management
- Create a new git branch for each feature or story
- Branch naming format: `{story-number}-{short-descriptive-title}`
  - Example: `1.1-user-authentication` or `2.3-api-rate-limiting`
- Use kebab-case for branch names (lowercase with hyphens)

#### Commit Strategy
- Commit after every successful addition or change
- "Successful" means the change passes all tests
- Never commit broken or failing code

#### Commit Messages
- Write comprehensive commit messages within GitHub's length limits
- Messages should give developers a clear understanding of:
  - What was done
  - What changes were made
  - Why the change was necessary (if not obvious)
- Use present tense and imperative mood
- Example: `Add user authentication middleware with JWT validation and rate limiting`

#### üö® ZERO TOLERANCE: Git Hook Bypassing Policy

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION:**

- **NEVER use `--no-verify` flag on commits or pushes**
- **NEVER use `--force` or `--force-with-lease` to bypass checks**
- **NEVER disable or bypass pre-commit hooks**
- **NEVER skip CI/CD pipeline validation**

**These commands are COMPLETELY PROHIBITED:**
```bash
# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - ZERO TOLERANCE
git commit --no-verify
git push --no-verify
git push --force
git push --force-with-lease
git commit -n  # shorthand for --no-verify
```

**CONSEQUENCES:**
- First violation: Immediate code review and retraining
- Second violation: Formal disciplinary action
- Third violation: Project removal

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Hooks enforce critical security, quality, and compliance checks
- Bypassing hooks introduces vulnerabilities, bugs, and technical debt
- Team code quality depends on consistent enforcement
- Client deliverables require verified, validated code

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS
git commit -m "Your message"
git push

# ‚úÖ IF HOOKS FAIL - FIX THE ISSUES, DON'T BYPASS
# 1. Read the hook failure message
# 2. Fix the identified issues
# 3. Run hooks locally: npm run lint, npm run test, etc.
# 4. Commit and push normally
```

### Core Principles

#### Keep It Simple
- Implement code in the fewest lines possible
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Choose straightforward approaches over clever ones

#### Optimize for Readability
- Prioritize code clarity over micro-optimizations
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for "why" not "what"

#### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated business logic to private methods
- Extract repeated UI markup to reusable components
- Create utility functions for common operations

#### File Structure
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Group related functionality together
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Elixir-Specific Practices

#### Code Quality & Consistency
- Use `mix format` for automatic code formatting
- Integrate Credo for static analysis and code quality checks
- Follow snake_case for variables/functions, CamelCase for modules
- Use trailing `!` for functions that raise exceptions, `?` for boolean returns

#### Function Complexity Guidelines
- **One Function = One Task**: Each function should have a single, clear responsibility
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Keep complexity ‚â§9 (Credo default maximum)
- **Nesting Depth**: Limit function body nesting to ‚â§2 levels deep (Credo default)
- **Function Length**: Aim for functions under 20 lines when possible
- **Refactoring Strategy**: When functions become complex:
  - Extract helper functions for subtasks
  - Use early returns to reduce nesting
  - Break down conditional logic into separate functions
  - Consider using `with` statements for happy path flows

#### Documentation Standards
- Write `@moduledoc` and `@doc` as public API contracts
- Use `@spec` for type specifications on all public functions
- Include testable examples with doctests
- Reserve inline comments (#) for implementation details only

#### Domain Organization
- Structure applications using Phoenix Contexts for domain boundaries
- Keep web layer thin - delegate business logic to contexts
- Use service/operation layers for cross-context coordination
- Avoid direct database access from controllers/LiveViews

#### Process Guidelines
- Use processes (GenServer) only for runtime properties: state, resources, concurrency
- Prefer plain modules for organizing pure functions
- Always supervise long-running processes
- Send minimal data in process messages to reduce copying overhead

#### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Primitive obsession (overusing strings/integers for domain concepts)
- Exceptions for control flow (prefer tagged tuples)
- Fat controllers/LiveViews (business logic belongs in contexts)
- Unsupervised processes

### Dependencies

#### Choose Libraries Wisely

When adding third-party dependencies:
- Select the most popular and actively maintained option
- Check the library's GitHub repository for:
  - Recent commits (within last 6 months)
  - Active issue resolution
  - Number of stars/downloads
  - Clear documentation

## Testing Standards

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Follow the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that describes desired behavior
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass  
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### Testing Best Practices

#### Test Structure (Arrange-Act-Assert)

```elixir
test "security confirmation engine approves low-risk operations automatically" do
  # Arrange
  engine = start_supervised!({ConfirmationEngine, []})
  low_risk_request = build_confirmation_request(:low_risk)
  
  # Act
  {:ok, result} = ConfirmationEngine.request_confirmation(engine, low_risk_request)
  
  # Assert
  assert result.approved == true
  assert result.reason == "Auto-approved: low risk operation"
end
```

#### Test Organization

- Use `describe` blocks to group related tests
- Each test should be independent and run in isolation
- Use `async: true` for tests that don't share state
- Create test data builders for complex structures

#### Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Minimum 70% coverage
- Focus on testing behaviors, not implementation details
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Don't test multiple things in one test
- Don't use `sleep` for timing - use proper synchronization
- Don't create overly complex test setup
- Don't ignore test performance

## Code Review Standards

### Review Checklist

All code reviews must verify:

1. **Functionality**: Code works as intended
