# 12. Testing Strategy

**Goal:** Define comprehensive testing approaches to ensure system reliability, security, and performance.

## **Testing Pyramid & Approach**

### **Unit Testing (Foundation - 70%)**

- **Coverage Target:** 90%+ for critical business logic
    
- **Focus Areas:**
    
    - Authentication modules (API key validation, OAuth flows)
        
    - HTTP client functionality (header construction, response parsing)
        
    - Database operations (CRUD, migrations, data integrity)
        
    - Tool execution logic (file operations, code execution safety)
        
    - Token counting and cost calculation accuracy
        
- **Testing Framework:** ExUnit with property-based testing using StreamData
    
- **Mocking Strategy:** Mock external API calls, use in-memory databases for isolated tests
    

### **Integration Testing (Middle - 25%)**

- **API Integration Tests:**
    
    - Real provider API calls with test credentials (rate-limited)
        
    - Database integration with PostgreSQL test instances
        
    - Redis session state management
        
    - Oban background job processing

    - Tool execution with file system interactions
        

### **End-to-End Testing (Top - 5%)**

- **User Journey Tests:**
    
    - Complete authentication flows for all three providers
        
    - Multi-session management and context switching
        
    - Agent tool usage workflows (file operations, code execution)
        
    - TUI-to-backend communication and session synchronization
