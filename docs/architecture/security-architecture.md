# 9. Security Architecture

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive security design addressing the threat model from PRD requirements.

## 9.1. Threat Model & Security Controls

### **Attack Vectors & Mitigations**

| **Threat** | **Impact** | **Mitigation** | **Implementation** |
|------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Credential Theft | HIGH | Encrypted storage | ClakEcto with AES-256 |
| Code Injection via Tools | HIGH | Input sanitization | Validation + sandboxing |
| Path Traversal | MEDIUM | Path validation | Bounded file access |
| Token Hijacking | MEDIUM | Secure storage | HTTP-only, encrypted tokens |
| API Key Exposure | HIGH | Environment isolation | Never log sensitive data |

## 9.2. Credential Security Architecture

### **Encryption Implementation**
