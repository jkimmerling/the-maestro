# 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical architecture for **The Maestro**, an LLM orchestration platform. The system is designed as a monolithic Elixir application built on the Phoenix framework, prioritizing developer productivity, real-time interactivity, and direct system access for the AI agents. It will be supplemented by a standalone Terminal User Interface (TUI) client that communicates with the main application via a dedicated API.

## 1.1. Architectural Goals & Constraints

- **Primary Goal: Developer Enablement:** The architecture must maximize the power and flexibility available to the single user. The AI agents are to be treated as trusted collaborators, not sandboxed entities.
    
- **Real-time Interaction:** All user-facing interfaces (Web and TUI) must be fully real-time, providing immediate feedback on agent status, "thoughts," and tool execution.
    
- **Maintainability:** As a solo-developer project, the codebase must be clear, well-structured, and easy to maintain. The choice of a Phoenix monolith supports this by keeping all core logic in a single, cohesive application.
    
- **High Concurrency:** The system must leverage Elixir/OTP to efficiently manage dozens of concurrent LLM sessions and background tasks without performance degradation.
    
- **Constraint: Single-Tenancy:** The entire system is designed for a single user. There are no requirements for multi-tenancy, complex user roles, or permissions.
    
- **Constraint: Exact API Fidelity:** A hard constraint is that all communication with external LLM providers must precisely replicate the headers and authentication flows of the `llxprt` and `gemini-cli` reference applications.
