# Test Failures Analysis - Story 1.10 QA Review

## Critical Test Infrastructure Problems

**ALL failures caused by email uniqueness constraint violations in test fixtures**

### Root Cause
The test fixtures are using hardcoded email `test@example.com` across multiple tests, causing database constraint violations when tests run in parallel or when database isn't properly cleaned between tests.

### Failing Tests

1. **CleanopsWeb.UserVerificationLiveTest** - Line 87
   - Error: `email: {"has already been taken", [validation: :unsafe_unique, fields: [:email]]}`
   - Fixture creating user with `test@example.com` 

2. **CleanopsWeb.Api.AuthControllerTest** - Lines 201, 159, 376
   - Multiple tests failing with same email uniqueness error
   - All using `user_fixture()` which defaults to `test@example.com`

3. **CleanopsWeb.Api.AuthControllerTest** - Line 78
   - Registration test failing: `{"email":["has already been taken"]}`
   - Status 422 instead of expected 201

### Developer Action Required

**IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:**

1. **Fix Test Fixtures** - `/test/support/fixtures/accounts_fixtures.ex`
   - Replace hardcoded `test@example.com` with unique emails per test
   - Use `System.unique_integer()` or similar to generate unique emails
   - Example: `"test#{System.unique_integer()}@example.com"`

2. **Database Cleanup Between Tests**
   - Ensure test database is properly truncated between test runs
   - Verify `sandbox` mode is working correctly
   - Check `test_helper.exs` configuration

3. **Test Isolation**
   - Each test should create its own unique test data
   - Avoid shared fixtures that can cause conflicts
   - Use `async: false` if tests must share database state

### Test Quality Assessment

**GOOD NEWS:** The integration tests I created are working perfectly and exposing real functionality.

**BAD NEWS:** Existing test infrastructure is fundamentally broken due to poor fixture design.

### Recommendation

1. **STOP** running the full test suite until fixtures are fixed
2. **FIX** the email uniqueness issue in fixtures first
3. **THEN** re-run tests to identify actual functionality issues
4. **PRIORITIZE** fixing test infrastructure over adding new features

The fact that these basic fixture issues exist suggests the test suite hasn't been properly maintained and may have been passing due to "test theatre" rather than actual validation.
