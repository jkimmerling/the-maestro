nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      REAL API key loaded from environment (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), no hardcoding.
      Keys never printed; redact if accidentally logged and rotate immediately.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Streaming stable; first token under 2s; connection reuse via Req/Finch"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Named sessions persisted; retries and error handling in place"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Follows provider interface; clear module boundaries and typespecs"

qa_directives:
  - "E2E validations MUST use a REAL OpenAI API key from env (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)."
  - "Do NOT use dummy keys for success-path validation."
  - "Dummy/invalid keys are permitted ONLY for explicit negative tests (e.g., auth/billing failures) and must be labeled as such."

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Ensure all E2E runs include env-based real-key verification step before execution"
      refs: ["scripts/test_openai_api_key_streaming_e2e.exs"]
  future:
    - action: "Add test tag to separate negative (invalid key) scenarios from success-path runs"
