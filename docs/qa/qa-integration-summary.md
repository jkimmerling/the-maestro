# QA Integration with Pre-Push Hook - Implementation Summary

## üéØ **Overview**

The QA process has been enhanced to **mandate** pre-push hook execution as a core validation step. All QA reports must now include pre-push hook results, and any failures must be documented and resolved before story approval.

## üìã **What Was Updated**

### 1. **Story Draft Checklist** (`.bmad-core/checklists/story-draft-checklist.md`)
**New Section 6 Requirements:**
- Added **PRE-PUSH HOOK VALIDATION** as mandatory checklist item
- Stories must explicitly require QA to execute `.git/hooks/pre-push`
- Added to validation table as required section

### 2. **QA Gate Template** (`docs/qa/qa-gate-template.yml`)
**New Mandatory Sections:**
```yaml
# MANDATORY: Pre-Push Hook Validation
pre_push_validation:
  executed: true  # REQUIRED: Must be true for all stories
  status: PASS|FAIL
  hook_output: |
    # Complete hook execution output
  issues_found: []  # List any hook failures
  resolution:
    status: resolved|pending|waived

hook_metrics:
  compilation_time: "seconds"
  test_execution_time: "seconds" 
  test_count: 0
  test_failures: 0
  credo_issues_total: 0
  dialyzer_warnings: 0
```

### 3. **Pre-Push Validation Guide** (`docs/qa/pre-push-validation-guide.md`)
**Comprehensive QA documentation:**
- Step-by-step hook execution process
- Issue categorization and severity mapping
- Gate decision matrix based on hook results
- Common failure scenarios and fixes
- Integration with existing QA workflow

### 4. **Quality Standards** (`docs/standards/quality-standards.md`)
**Updated requirements:**
- Added pre-push hook as first mandatory quality enforcement
- Updated QA validation requirements
- Modified sub-agent validation requirements

### 5. **QA UI Quality Checklist** (`docs/architecture/qa-ui-checklist.md`)
**Enhanced with hook validation:**
- Added mandatory pre-push hook section before any testing
- Updated rejection criteria to include hook failures
- Added specific checks for test failures, Dialyzer warnings, Credo issues

## üîÑ **New QA Workflow**

### **Enhanced QA Process:**
1. **Receive Story** ‚Üí Set up environment (git checkout feature branch)
2. **üö® EXECUTE PRE-PUSH HOOK** (`.git/hooks/pre-push`) ‚Üê **NEW MANDATORY STEP**
3. **Document Hook Results** ‚Üí Capture complete output and categorize issues
4. **Continue with Functional Testing** ‚Üí Standard QA testing procedures
5. **Make Gate Decision** ‚Üí Consider hook results in gate status
6. **Create QA Report** ‚Üí Include mandatory pre-push validation section

### **Gate Decision Logic:**
| Hook Status | Other Issues | Gate Decision |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **PASS** | None | **PASS** |
| **PASS** | Minor issues only | **PASS** |  
| **PASS** | Major functional issues | **CONCERNS** |
| **FAIL** | Any check failed | **FAIL** or **CONCERNS** |

## üö® **Critical Requirements for QA Teams**

### **MANDATORY ACTIONS:**
1. ‚úÖ **Execute `.git/hooks/pre-push`** for every story
2. ‚úÖ **Capture complete hook output** in QA report
3. ‚úÖ **Document any failures** as issues with severity levels
4. ‚úÖ **Block approval** until critical hook failures resolved
5. ‚úÖ **Re-run hook** after fixes to verify resolution

### **REJECTION CRITERIA:**
‚ùå **Must reject stories that have:**
- Pre-push hook not executed
- Test suite failures (must be 100% pass rate)
- Compilation errors or warnings
- Critical Credo code quality issues
- Dialyzer type safety warnings
- Unresolved hook failures

## üìä **Issue Categorization**

### **Hook Failure ‚Üí QA Issue Mapping:**
| Hook Failure | QA Severity | QA Action |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Test failures** | `critical` | FAIL gate - Must fix |
| **Compilation errors** | `critical` | FAIL gate - Must fix |
| **Dialyzer errors** | `high` | CONCERNS gate - Should fix |
| **Formatting issues** | `medium` | CONCERNS gate - Easy fix |
| **Credo critical** | `high` | CONCERNS gate - Should fix |
| **Dependencies** | `critical` | FAIL gate - Must fix |

## üõ†Ô∏è **QA Report Template Integration**

### **Required QA Report Sections:**
All QA reports must now include:

```yaml
# MANDATORY SECTION
pre_push_validation:
  executed: true
  status: PASS|FAIL
  hook_output: |
    [Complete hook execution output]
  issues_found:
    - id: "HOOK-001"
      category: "tests|compilation|formatting|credo|dialyzer|dependencies"
      finding: "Description of issue"
      severity: "critical|high|medium|low"
      action_required: "What needs to be fixed"
  resolution:
    status: "resolved|pending|waived"

# ENHANCED EVIDENCE SECTION  
evidence:
  pre_push_executed: true        # MANDATORY
  dialyzer_clean: true|false     # From hook
  credo_issues: 0               # From hook  
  test_failures: 0              # From hook

# NEW QUALITY METRICS SECTION
hook_metrics:
  compilation_time: "2.1s"
  test_execution_time: "0.3s" 
  test_count: 23
  test_failures: 0
  credo_issues_total: 0
  dialyzer_warnings: 0
```

## üìà **Benefits for Project Quality**
